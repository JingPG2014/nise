Building and installation instructions.

= Prerequisites =

NISE depends on the following software:

  * [http://www.boost.org Boost library]
  * [http://pocoproject.org/ Poco library]
  * Hadoop C++ library (libhadooppipes.a & libhadooputils.a)
  * [http://lshkit.sourceforge.net LSHKIT]
  * [http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/core/hadoop-0.21.0/ Hadoop 0.21.0]
  * [http://www.ijg.org/files/jpegsrc.v8d.tar.gz jpeglib] (we need the functions jpeg_mem_src/dest that only present in the 8.x version).
  * GCC with C++11 support, cmake, java, ant
  * Various other libraries typically present in the system.

= Building =

== Directory layout ==

Put the nise code, LSHKIT code and an empty build directory in a directory structure like the following (SRC can be any directory):
  
{{{
[SRC] $ ls
lshkit nise
}}}


== C++ part ==

  Run the following:

{{{
[SRC]$ cd nise
[nise]$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ../nise
[nise]$ make
}}}

The executables will be produced in the directory SRC/nise/bin .
  
== Java part ==

  Run the following

{{{
[SRC]$ cd nise/java
[java]$ ant jar
}}}
