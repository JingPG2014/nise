Building and installation instructions.

= Prerequisites =

NISE depends on the following software:

  * [http://www.boost.org Boost library]
  * [http://pocoproject.org/ Poco library]
  * Hadoop C++ library (libhadooppipes.a & libhadooputils.a)
  * [http://lshkit.sourceforge.net LSHKIT]
  * [http://hadoop.apache.org/ Hadoop]
  * GCC and java
  * Various other libraries like libjpeg which are typically present in the system.

= Building =

== Directory layout ==

Put the nise code, LSHKIT code and an empty build directory in a directory structure like the following (SRC can be any directory):
  
  * SRC/nise
  * SRC/lshkit
  * SRC/build


== C++ part ==

  Run the following:

[SRC]$ cd build
[build]$ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release ../nise
[build]$ make

The executables will be produced in the directory SRC/build/bin .
  
== Java part ==

  Run the following

[SRC]\$ cd nise/java
[java]\$ ant jar
